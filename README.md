_Unearthing mankind's best quotes, one epigraph at a time_

This webapp is being developed by me, [Fred Rocha](https://fredrocha.net/), in public. You can tag along
for the adventure [here](https://fredrocha.net/2024/08/07/building-a-crud-application-using-ruby-on-rails-in-2024/).

Some novelists choose to open their books with a quote from another writer. This is called an [epigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraph_(literature)). These quotes 
taken out of their original context are given a new life, necessarily detached from the former one. Since writers are 
the utmost specialists in their fields, and since the beginning of a work has such relevance to the whole, I risk saying 
that these selected quotes will necessarily be the crème de la crème of the world’s literature. Change my mind.

This website / webapp will be a repository for those epigraphs. Send your own favorites.
